✅ Simple & clean UI with Minecraft-inspired font

Hi! I’m a student who loves building creative web tools that make studying and productivity fun.
Study-Doro started as a personal side project to learn React and make my own aesthetic Pomodoro timer.
Every line of code here was written while vibing to lofi and coffee ☕.
